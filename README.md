# tcg-tracker

## Wellcome to my app

This is where I will describe my app. I have created a TCG tracker using mongoose, express, react, and redux.

My app is running on port 4500. If you want to run it you have to use terminal(nodemon server.js) and it
going to show you in which port does this app runs.

The first thing you going to see in my app is a form. Whereby student has to fill up their daily progress. After filling that form they is a submit button. If you press submit button without filling the form is going to tell you to fill up the space before you submit.

After pressing a submit button is going to redirect you to another page whereby you will see all the details.

I also created an edit button. You can press the edit button if you want to edit the code wars score any. I also have the delete button.
You can use the delete button if you have made a mistake.
